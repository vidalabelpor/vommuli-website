# Comprehensive Performance Audit

Analyze and optimize website performance for Core Web Vitals and user experience.

## Performance Audit for: $ARGUMENTS

Conduct thorough performance analysis and optimization:

### 1. Core Web Vitals Analysis
**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - Target: <2.5s**
- [ ] Analyze critical rendering path
- [ ] Optimize hero images and above-fold content
- [ ] Implement resource preloading
- [ ] Minimize render-blocking resources

**First Input Delay (FID) - Target: <100ms**
- [ ] Analyze JavaScript execution time
- [ ] Optimize third-party scripts
- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Reduce main thread blocking time

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - Target: <0.1**
- [ ] Reserve space for images and videos
- [ ] Optimize font loading with font-display
- [ ] Avoid inserting content above existing content
- [ ] Use transform animations instead of layout changes

### 2. Lighthouse Performance Audit
Run comprehensive Lighthouse analysis:
- [ ] Performance score (target: 95+)
- [ ] Accessibility score (target: 95+)
- [ ] Best Practices score (target: 95+)
- [ ] SEO score (target: 95+)

### 3. Bundle Size Analysis
- [ ] Analyze JavaScript bundle sizes
- [ ] Identify and remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Implement tree shaking optimization
- [ ] Use dynamic imports for non-critical code

### 4. Image Optimization
- [ ] Convert to WebP format with fallbacks
- [ ] Implement responsive image sizes
- [ ] Use lazy loading for below-fold images
- [ ] Optimize image compression ratios

### 5. Network Performance
- [ ] Analyze Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- [ ] Implement CDN for static assets
- [ ] Optimize caching strategies
- [ ] Minimize HTTP requests

### 6. Mobile Performance
- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices
- [ ] Analyze mobile-specific performance metrics
- [ ] Optimize for slower network connections
- [ ] Validate touch target sizes

### 7. Third-Party Integration Impact
- [ ] Audit third-party script performance
- [ ] Implement async/defer loading strategies
- [ ] Consider service worker caching
- [ ] Monitor real user metrics (RUM)

### 8. Vommuli Ventures Specific Optimizations
**Business Impact Considerations:**
- [ ] Optimize conversion-critical pages first
- [ ] Ensure forms load quickly on mobile
- [ ] Prioritize above-the-fold CTA performance
- [ ] Monitor impact on lead generation metrics

### 9. Monitoring and Continuous Optimization
- [ ] Set up Core Web Vitals monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance budgets
- [ ] Create automated performance testing
- [ ] Schedule regular performance audits

### 10. Implementation Priority Matrix
**High Priority (Immediate Impact):**
- Critical rendering path optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- JavaScript bundle optimization

**Medium Priority (SEO Impact):**
- Third-party script optimization
