# Visual Regression Testing with Playwright MCP

Automated visual testing and comparison for design validation using Playwright MCP's screenshot capabilities.

## Visual Testing for: $ARGUMENTS

Execute comprehensive visual regression testing to ensure pixel-perfect design implementation.

### 1. Automated Screenshot Capture
- [ ] **Baseline Screenshots**: Capture reference images across all target devices
  - Desktop: 1920x1080, 1440x900, 1366x768
  - Tablet: 1024x768, 768x1024 (iPad orientations)
  - Mobile: 375x667 (iPhone), 414x896 (iPhone Plus), 360x640 (Android)
- [ ] **Current Implementation**: Generate fresh screenshots of live components
- [ ] **Figma Comparison**: Use mcp__figma__get_image for design reference screenshots
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari screenshot capture

### 2. Visual Difference Analysis
- [ ] **Pixel-Level Comparison**: Automated diff generation with highlighted changes
- [ ] **Color Accuracy Validation**: Verify hex codes match design specifications
- [ ] **Typography Rendering**: Font family, weight, and size consistency check
- [ ] **Spacing Precision**: Margin, padding, and layout measurements validation
- [ ] **Interactive State Testing**: Hover, focus, active, and disabled states

### 3. Responsive Breakpoint Validation
- [ ] **Mobile-First Testing** (320px-767px)
  - Navigation collapse behavior
  - Touch target size validation (44px minimum)
  - Form input optimization
  - Content readability and hierarchy
- [ ] **Tablet Testing** (768px-1023px)
  - Layout adaptation and grid behavior
  - Navigation pattern consistency
  - Content flow and readability
- [ ] **Desktop Testing** (1024px+)
  - Full layout implementation
  - Multi-column content organization
  - Advanced interaction patterns

### 4. Brand Consistency Validation
- [ ] **Financial Services Professionalism**: Visual tone appropriate for VC audience
- [ ] **Color Palette Adherence**: Consistent use of brand colors throughout
- [ ] **Typography Hierarchy**: Professional heading and body text implementation
- [ ] **Component Consistency**: Buttons, cards, forms follow design system
- [ ] **Trust Signal Integration**: Professional imagery and credential presentation

### 5. Performance Impact Assessment
- [ ] **Layout Shift Detection**: Measure and minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- [ ] **Image Optimization Validation**: WebP format, proper sizing, lazy loading
- [ ] **Animation Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations, no janky interactions
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals Impact**: Ensure design doesn't compromise performance metrics

### 6. Accessibility Visual Compliance
- [ ] **Color Contrast Ratios**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] **Focus Indicator Visibility**: Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Text Readability**: Sufficient font sizes and line spacing
- [ ] **Interactive Element Clarity**: Clear affordances for clickable elements

### 7. Vommuli Ventures Specific Validation
- [ ] **Conversion Optimization**: CTA buttons prominent and compelling
- [ ] **Lead Generation Focus**: Forms and contact elements highly visible
- [ ] **Professional Credibility**: Design supports financial services trust
- [ ] **SEO-Friendly Layout**: Proper heading hierarchy and content structure

### 8. Automated Testing Execution
```bash
# Playwright MCP commands for visual testing
npx playwright test --headed --project=visual-regression
npx playwright show-report visual-testing/reports/
```

### 9. Error Detection and Resolution
- [ ] **Console Error Analysis**: Browser console logs for JavaScript errors
- [ ] **Network Request Validation**: Failed resource loading detection
- [ ] **Rendering Error Identification**: Missing images, broken layouts
- [ ] **Performance Warning Assessment**: Slow-loading elements identification

### 10. Documentation and Reporting
- [ ] **Visual Diff Report**: Automated generation with before/after comparisons
- [ ] **Improvement Recommendations**: Prioritized list of visual enhancements
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility Notes**: Cross-browser rendering differences
- [ ] **Performance Impact Summary**: Design changes affecting Core Web Vitals

**Success Criteria:**
- Visual implementation within 2px tolerance of Figma designs
- Consistent rendering across all target browsers and devices
- Zero accessibility violations (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Core Web Vitals scores maintained or improved
- Professional appearance appropriate for financial services

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive visual regression test report with automated screenshots, difference analysis, and prioritized improvement recommendations for pixel-perfect design implementation.
