# Figma-to-Implementation Visual Validation

Automated synchronization and validation between Figma designs and live implementation using Figma MCP integration.

## Figma Sync for: $ARGUMENTS

Execute comprehensive Figma-to-code validation workflow ensuring pixel-perfect design implementation.

### 1. Figma Component Extraction
- [ ] **Design Specification Retrieval**
  - Use `mcp__figma__get_code` to extract component code and specifications
  - Use `mcp__figma__get_image` to generate reference design images
  - Use `mcp__figma__get_variable_defs` to retrieve design tokens and variables
- [ ] **Component Mapping Analysis**
  - Map Figma component IDs to React component implementations
  - Document design token usage and implementation gaps
  - Identify component variants and state specifications

### 2. Design Token Validation
- [ ] **Color System Verification**
  - Extract Figma color variables and compare with CSS implementation
  - Validate hex code accuracy across all brand colors
  - Verify color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
- [ ] **Typography Token Consistency**
  - Font family implementation (Inter font system)
  - Font weight accuracy (400, 500, 600, 700)
  - Font size and line height precision
  - Letter spacing and text decoration consistency
- [ ] **Spacing and Layout Tokens**
  - Margin and padding value accuracy (8px grid system)
  - Border radius consistency across components
  - Shadow system implementation validation
  - Grid and layout spacing verification

### 3. Visual Comparison Pipeline
- [ ] **Screenshot Generation and Comparison**
  - Capture Figma design images for each component
  - Generate live implementation screenshots using Playwright MCP
  - Perform automated pixel-diff analysis
  - Highlight discrepancies with visual overlay annotations
- [ ] **Component State Validation**
  - Default state accuracy
  - Hover state implementation
  - Focus state visibility and design
  - Active/pressed state behavior
  - Disabled state styling
  - Loading state animations

### 4. Responsive Design Synchronization
- [ ] **Breakpoint-Specific Comparison**
  - Mobile Figma frames vs. mobile implementation
  - Tablet layout comparison and validation
  - Desktop design accuracy assessment
- [ ] **Adaptive Component Behavior**
  - Navigation collapse patterns

### 6. Interactive Element Validation
- [ ] **Form Component Accuracy**
  - Input field styling and states
  - Label positioning and typography
  - Error state design implementation
  - Validation message styling
- [ ] **Navigation Component Fidelity**
  - Menu item styling and spacing
  - Logo placement and sizing
  - Mobile navigation behavior
  - Breadcrumb implementation

### 7. Advanced Design System Integration
- [ ] **Component Library Consistency**
  - Button variants and sizing accuracy
  - Card component styling precision
  - Icon usage and sizing validation
  - Layout grid implementation
- [ ] **Design Pattern Implementation**
  - Content hierarchy and visual flow
  - Whitespace usage and balance
  - Visual rhythm and proportion
  - Brand guideline adherence

### 8. Automated Figma Integration Workflow
```bash
# Figma MCP integration commands
mcp__figma__get_code nodeId="component-node-id"
mcp__figma__get_image nodeId="component-node-id"
mcp__figma__get_variable_defs nodeId="design-system-node-id"
```

### 9. Iterative Design Refinement Process
- [ ] **Continuous Improvement Loop**
  - Identify design-implementation gaps
  - Generate specific code improvements
  - Re-test and validate changes
  - Update documentation and design system
- [ ] **Design System Evolution**
  - Track design token changes in Figma
  - Automatically update implementation
  - Maintain consistency across all components
  - Version control design system changes

### 10. Quality Assurance Integration
- [ ] **Performance Impact Assessment**
  - Ensure design fidelity doesn't compromise Core Web Vitals
  - Optimize images and assets from Figma
  - Validate animation performance
- [ ] **Accessibility Compliance Check**
  - Color contrast validation against Figma designs
  - Focus state implementation accuracy
  - Screen reader compatibility maintenance

### 11. Documentation and Reporting
- [ ] **Design-Implementation Gap Analysis**
  - Visual comparison reports with annotations
  - Specific improvement recommendations
  - Priority scoring for implementation changes
- [ ] **Design System Documentation**
  - Component usage guidelines
  - Design token implementation guide
  - Brand compliance checklist

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% design token accuracy between Figma and implementation
- Visual components within 2px tolerance of Figma designs
- All interactive states properly implemented
- Responsive behavior matches Figma responsive frames
- Professional financial services visual standards maintained

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive Figma-implementation synchronization report with visual comparisons, design token validation, and specific recommendations for achieving pixel-perfect design implementation aligned with Vommuli Ventures' professional brand standards.
