    question: 'What makes climate tech and renewable energy funding different from traditional venture capital?',
    answer: 'Climate tech funding focuses on companies developing solutions for decarbonization, energy transition, and environmental sustainability. Unlike traditional VC, climate investors emphasize environmental impact alongside financial returns, often requiring longer development timelines, regulatory navigation, and specialized technical expertise. Climate funds typically understand complex energy markets, policy landscapes, and sustainability metrics.',
    category: 'Climate Tech Fundamentals'
  },
  {
    question: 'What stage companies are ideal for climate tech and renewable energy funding?',
    answer: 'Ideal climate tech candidates range from early-stage R&D companies with breakthrough technologies to growth-stage companies with proven clean energy solutions. Investors seek companies with strong IP portfolios, regulatory compliance, market validation, experienced technical teams, and clear paths to commercial scalability in renewable energy, energy storage, carbon capture, or sustainable technologies.',
    category: 'Company Profile'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does climate tech fundraising typically take?',
    answer: 'Climate tech fundraising averages 6-12 months depending on technology maturity, regulatory complexity, and market readiness. Deep tech solutions (12-18 months), proven renewable technologies (4-8 months), later-stage climate solutions (6-10 months). Climate tech companies typically require specialized investor education due to technical complexity and longer development cycles.',
    category: 'Timeline'
  },
  {
    question: 'What climate tech sectors are most attractive to investors currently?',
    answer: 'High-growth climate sectors include renewable energy storage (+94% YoY funding), carbon capture & utilization (+78% YoY), clean transportation (+65% YoY), and sustainable agriculture (+52% YoY). Investors favor technologies addressing large carbon reduction opportunities, regulatory tailwinds, established revenue models, and scalable deployment potential.',
    category: 'Market Segments'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you evaluate if a climate tech company is ready for institutional funding?',
    answer: 'We assess climate tech readiness across seven dimensions: technology maturity (IP strength, pilot validation), market opportunity (addressable carbon impact, commercial viability), regulatory environment (policy support, compliance status), team expertise (technical depth, industry experience), financial projections (unit economics, scaling models), competitive positioning (differentiation, barriers to entry), and impact measurement (ESG metrics, sustainability outcomes).',
    category: 'Investment Readiness'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are typical climate tech valuation ranges by development stage?',
    answer: 'Climate tech valuations vary by technology risk, market size, and development stage. Current ranges: Pre-revenue/R&D ($5M-25M), Pilot/demonstration ($25M-75M), Commercial deployment ($75M-250M), Scaled operations ($250M-1B+). Valuations consider technology differentiation, carbon impact potential, regulatory advantages, and commercial traction alongside traditional financial metrics.',
    category: 'Valuation'
  },
  {
    question: 'How many climate tech and renewable energy investors are in your network?',
    answer: 'Our network includes 120+ climate-focused investors, including dedicated climate funds like Breakthrough Energy Ventures, traditional VCs with climate mandates like NEA and Kleiner Perkins, corporate strategic investors, government-backed funds, and international climate capital sources managing $150B+ in climate-focused capital across North America, Europe, and Asia.',
