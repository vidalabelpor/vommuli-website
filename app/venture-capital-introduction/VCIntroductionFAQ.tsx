    question: 'What is the success rate for venture capital introductions?',
    answer: 'Our venture capital introduction service achieves a 67% introduction-to-term-sheet success rate, which is 12% above the industry average. This high success rate is achieved through our rigorous VC qualification process, strategic positioning approach, and established relationships with 200+ tier-1 venture capital firms. Success rates vary by stage: Series A (72%), Series B (68%), and Series C+ (61%), reflecting the increasing selectivity at later stages.',

  {
    question: 'How long does the VC introduction process take from start to term sheet?',
    answer: 'The complete VC introduction process typically takes 3-9 months, depending on company readiness, market conditions, and funding stage. The timeline includes: strategy development and positioning (2-3 weeks), VC identification and qualification (3-4 weeks), introduction phase with initial meetings (4-8 weeks), and due diligence with term sheet negotiation (8-16 weeks). Well-prepared companies with strong metrics often complete the process 35% faster than industry averages.',

  },
  {
    question: 'What funding stages and company types do you work with for VC introductions?',
    answer: 'We support all venture capital funding stages: Series A ($2M-$20M, requiring $1M+ ARR), Series B ($10M-$50M, requiring $5M+ ARR), and Series C+ ($25M-$200M, requiring $20M+ ARR). We work with technology companies, healthcare/biotech firms, AI/ML platforms, climate tech startups, and fintech companies.

  {
    question: 'How many VC firms are in your network and what types of investors do you work with?',
    answer: 'Our network includes 200+ tier-1 venture capital firms globally, spanning institutional VCs like Andreessen Horowitz-tier firms, sector-focused specialists in AI/healthcare/fintech, and international growth capital partners across US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific markets.

We maintain active relationships with partners, principals, and investment committee members to ensure optimal introduction pathways.',
    category: 'Network'
  },
  {
    question: 'What sectors and industries do you specialize in for VC introductions?',
    answer: 'We specialize in high-growth sectors including AI & deep technology (34% of current VC allocation), healthcare & biotech, fintech & enterprise software, climate & ESG investments, and vertical SaaS platforms.

  },
  {
    question: 'What information and materials do you need to begin a VC introduction engagement?',
    answer: 'To begin a VC introduction engagement, we typically need: company overview and business model description, three years of historical financial performance and forward projections, current traction metrics and KPIs, target funding amount and intended use of capital, existing investor relationships and any constraints, management team backgrounds and board composition, competitive analysis and market positioning materials, and fundraising timeline requirements. We also conduct a comprehensive readiness assessment to identify any gaps that could impact VC reception.',
    category: 'Requirements'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you ensure confidentiality during the VC introduction process?',
    answer: 'We maintain strict confidentiality protocols throughout all engagements. All initial consultations are completely confidential with no information sharing, we execute comprehensive NDAs before any detailed business information sharing, VC introductions are made only with explicit client approval and controlled information release, and we follow professional investment banking confidentiality standards. We never share client information, strategy details, fundraising plans, or financial data without written consent. Our relationship approach ensures discrete, professional handling of all sensitive business information.',
    category: 'Confidentiality'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if VCs are not initially interested, and how do you manage the introduction process?',
    answer: 'If initial VC interest is limited, we analyze feedback to identify positioning adjustments, business model refinements, or timing considerations. Our process includes ongoing relationship management with follow-up strategies, quarterly updates to maintain VC awareness, pivoting to alternative VC targets with different investment theses, and business development support to strengthen company metrics before re-engagement. We maintain long-term relationships with VCs to enable future introductions as companies evolve and market conditions change. Our success comes from persistence and strategic iteration rather than one-time introduction attempts.',
