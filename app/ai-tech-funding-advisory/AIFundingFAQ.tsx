    question: 'What makes AI funding different from traditional tech funding?',
    answer: 'AI funding requires specialized technical due diligence, including model performance validation, data quality assessment, scalability analysis, and bias testing. Investors evaluate AI companies on technical metrics like model accuracy, computational efficiency, and data moats rather than just traditional business metrics. AI companies also command 2-3x premiums over traditional software due to technical barriers and market opportunity size.',

    category: 'Market Segments'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you evaluate if an AI company is investment-ready?',
    answer: 'We assess AI companies across four key dimensions: technical excellence (model performance, data quality), market validation (customer traction, use case validation), team expertise (AI/ML talent depth), and competitive positioning (technical moats, IP). Our evaluation framework includes technical readiness checklists, business validation metrics, and competitive analysis to identify gaps and optimization opportunities.',
