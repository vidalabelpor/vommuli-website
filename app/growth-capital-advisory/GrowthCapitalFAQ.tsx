    question: 'What makes growth capital different from traditional venture capital?',
    answer: 'Growth capital focuses on established, revenue-generating companies seeking expansion capital rather than early-stage startups. Growth investors typically take minority stakes in profitable businesses with proven business models, strong management teams, and clear expansion opportunities. Unlike VC, growth capital emphasizes cash flow generation, operational excellence, and strategic market expansion rather than pure innovation or market creation.',

    question: 'How do you evaluate if a company is ready for growth capital?',
