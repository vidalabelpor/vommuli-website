    question: 'What makes private equity funding different from venture capital or growth equity?',
    answer: 'Private equity focuses on established, profitable companies seeking buyout capital, recapitalization, or significant ownership transitions. PE investors typically acquire majority control, implement operational improvements, and work closely with management to drive value creation over 3-7 year hold periods. Unlike VC or growth equity, PE emphasizes cash flow generation, operational excellence, and strategic optimization rather than rapid scaling or market expansion.',

  },
  {
    question: 'What types of companies are ideal for private equity investment?',
    answer: 'Ideal PE candidates are typically mature companies with $10M-100M+ EBITDA, stable cash flows, established market positions, experienced management teams, and clear value creation opportunities. These businesses often have predictable revenue streams, strong competitive moats, optimization potential, and may be undergoing ownership transitions, management buyouts, or strategic repositioning.',

  {
    question: 'How long does private equity fundraising typically take?',
    answer: 'PE fundraising averages 6-12 months depending on company complexity, deal structure, and market conditions. Management buyouts (4-8 months), strategic recapitalizations (6-10 months), complex situations or auction processes (8-15 months). Our PE clients typically complete transactions 30% faster due to specialized investor targeting, comprehensive preparation, and deal structuring expertise.',

    question: 'What private equity market segments are most active currently?',
    answer: 'Active PE segments include healthcare services (+76% YoY activity), business services (+68% YoY), technology services (+54% YoY), and industrial manufacturing (+41% YoY). PE firms favor businesses with recurring revenue, asset-light models, fragmented markets for roll-up opportunities, and strong defensive characteristics in economic downturns.',

  },
  {
    question: 'How do you evaluate if a company is ready for private equity?',
    answer: 'We assess PE readiness across seven key dimensions: financial performance (EBITDA generation, cash conversion), operational maturity (systems, processes, management depth), market position (competitive advantages, customer relationships), value creation opportunities (optimization potential, growth vectors), management alignment (ownership, incentives), deal structure considerations (debt capacity, valuation expectations), and transaction readiness (governance, reporting capabilities).',
    category: 'Investment Readiness'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are typical private equity valuation ranges by company size?',

Lower middle market PE typically pays 4-8x EBITDA, while larger funds may pay 8-15x+ for premium assets. Valuations also depend on growth rate, market position, and strategic value.',

  },
