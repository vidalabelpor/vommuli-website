# VISUAL DESIGN WORKFLOW - VOMMULI VENTURES

## Overview
Comprehensive visual design workflow that enables Claude Code to "see" and iteratively improve designs through Playwright MCP integration and automated visual validation.

## Design Workflow Philosophy

### Core Principle: Iterative Agentic Design Loop
```
Design Specification → Implementation → Screenshot → Compare → Analyze → Improve → Validate → Repeat
```

This continuous feedback loop enables Claude Code to achieve pixel-perfect implementations through visual intelligence rather than code-only development.

## Visual Design Workflow Components

### 1. Design Context Provision
**Objective:** Provide Claude Code with comprehensive visual context for informed design decisions.

#### Design Specifications Framework
- **Visual Requirements**: Exact design specifications with measurements, colors, and typography
- **Figma Integration**: Direct access to design files using MCP integration
- **Brand Guidelines**: Professional financial services design standards
- **Design Principles**: Comprehensive list of visual design rules and standards

#### Visual Reference Materials
- **Figma Design Files**: Complete component library and page designs
- **Brand Style Guide**: Logo usage, color palette, typography system
- **Reference Screenshots**: Inspirational designs and competitor analysis
- **Component States**: All interaction states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)

### 2. Figma-to-Implementation Pipeline

#### Local Figma File Setup
**Primary Design Source:** `/Users/vidal.porto/vommuli-website/design-system/❖ Untitled UI – PRO STYLES (v6.0) RPUrGtd6inrq (Copy).fig`

**Prerequisites:**
1. Ensure local Untitled UI file is open in Figma Desktop App
2. Verify MCP connection to Figma is active
3. Navigate to specific component or page in local file

#### Phase 1: Design Extraction from Local File
```bash
# Extract design specifications from local Untitled UI file
mcp__figma__get_code nodeId="component-123"
mcp__figma__get_image nodeId="component-123"
mcp__figma__get_variable_defs nodeId="design-system"

# Note: All commands operate on locally saved Untitled UI Design Kit
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation with Visual Context
- Implement React components with exact design specifications
- Use extracted design tokens for consistent styling
- Apply responsive breakpoint specifications from Figma frames

#### Phase 3: Visual Validation
- Capture implementation screenshots using Playwright MCP
- Compare with Figma design images pixel-by-pixel
- Generate visual difference reports with improvement recommendations

### 3. Iterative Visual Refinement Process

#### Continuous Improvement Loop
1. **Initial Implementation**
   - Code component following Figma specifications
   - Implement responsive behavior across breakpoints
   - Add accessibility features and interactions

2. **Automated Screenshot Capture**
   ```bash
   # Playwright MCP screenshot automation
   npx playwright test --project=visual-regression
   ```

3. **Visual Comparison Analysis**
   - Automated pixel-diff generation
   - Color accuracy validation
   - Typography rendering verification
   - Spacing and layout precision check

4. **Improvement Implementation**
   - Address identified visual discrepancies
   - Refine styling for pixel-perfect accuracy
   - Optimize for performance without compromising design

5. **Validation and Approval**
   - Final visual validation against design specifications
   - Cross-browser compatibility verification
   - Responsive behavior confirmation

### 4. Multi-Device Visual Testing Strategy

#### Device Testing Matrix
| Device Category | Viewport Sizes | Testing Focus |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Mobile** | 375x667, 414x896, 360x640 | Touch targets, navigation, content hierarchy |
| **Tablet** | 768x1024, 1024x768 | Layout adaptation, content flow |
| **Desktop** | 1440x900, 1920x1080 | Full feature implementation, advanced layouts |

#### Cross-Browser Validation
- **Chrome**: Primary development and testing browser
- **Firefox**: Alternative rendering engine validation
- **Safari**: iOS compatibility and WebKit-specific behaviors

### 5. Visual Quality Standards

#### Pixel-Perfect Implementation Requirements
- **Tolerance**: Maximum 2px deviation from Figma designs
- **Color Accuracy**: Exact hex code implementation
- **Typography**: Precise font family, weight, and size matching
- **Spacing**: Accurate margin, padding, and layout measurements

#### Professional Financial Services Standards
- **Visual Tone**: Conservative, trustworthy, professional
- **Brand Consistency**: Consistent application of brand elements
- **Credibility Signals**: Proper placement of trust indicators
- **Industry Appropriateness**: Suitable for VC and startup audiences

### 6. Automated Design Review System

#### Design Review Agents
- **Visual Analysis Agent**: Design system compliance and brand consistency
- **Accessibility Agent**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
- **Performance Agent**: Core Web Vitals impact assessment
- **UX Agent**: User experience and conversion optimization

#### Quality Scoring Framework
```
Overall Design Score (100 points):
- Visual Consistency: 25 points
- Brand Compliance: 20 points
- Accessibility: 20 points
- Performance Impact: 15 points
- User Experience: 10 points
