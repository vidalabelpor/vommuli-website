# CORE DEVELOPMENT RULES - VOMMULI VENTURES

## Required Context Reading
Before making any changes, always read:
- `PRD.md`: Project requirements and current phase
- `docs/architecture.md`: System architecture patterns
- `docs/seo-strategy.md`: SEO requirements and targets
- `tasks/current-phase.md`: Active development priorities

## TypeScript & React Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive typing
- Prefer Server Components; use Client Components only when necessary
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use Zod for all data validation and API schemas
- Structure components: exports → components → helpers → types

## Performance Requirements
- Target Core Web Vitals: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
- Lighthouse scores must be 95+ across all metrics
- Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical components
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports

## SEO Compliance
- Every page must include optimized metadata
- Implement structured data (JSON-LD) for all content types
- Use semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Include alt text for all images with keyword optimization
- Maintain consistent internal linking strategy
